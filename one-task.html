        <p class="para-one">A paragraph is a series of sentences that are
            organized and coherent,
            and are all related to a single topic. Almost every piece of writing
            you do
            that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into
            paragraphs.
            This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of
            an
            essay begin and end, and thus help the reader see the organization
            of the essay and grasp its main points.
            Paragraphs can contain many different kinds of information.
            A paragraph could contain a series of brief examples or a single
            long illustration of a general point. It might describe a place,
            character, or process; narrate a series of events; compare or
            contrast two or more things; classify items into categories; or
            describe causes and effects. Regardless of the kind of information
            they contain, all paragraphs share certain characteristics. One of
            the most important of these is a topic sentence.</p>
